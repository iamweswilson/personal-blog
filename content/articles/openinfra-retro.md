The [Open Infrastructure Foundation](https://openinfa.dev) was recently [announced](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/the-openstack-foundation-becomes-the-open-infrastructure-foundation/) as the successor to the OpenStack Foundation. It's a move years in the making and a launch we've been working on since last year and took coordinated work on PR, marketing, advertising, web, and partnerships.

I designed this retro feeling design as a way to celebrate the new community rallying cry: "We are OpenInfra".
