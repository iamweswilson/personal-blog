In my younger years (aka early 2020), I scoured the internet for 7-point stars or stars with fatter points. Is that what you call them, points? Since then, I've learned that Illustrator offers some simple ways to create unique stars all your own. Here are a few of the lessons learned:

### Changing the number of points in a star
Create your star using the star tool, but don't let go of your mouse button. While holding the button down, click up or down arrow keys to increase/decrease the number of points in your star. Then release your mouse to complete the star.

### Changing the size of the points in a star
Similar to adding/removing points, you want to create the star and keep your mouse button held down. Then hold down the command âŒ˜ key and drag your mouse to change the size of the points. Release to create your star.

### Making a "perfect" star
Perfectly aligned star with perfectly spaced points is as easy as holding shift and option. Shift aligns the star and options adjusts the point sizing. Similar to the previous tips, don't let go of the mouse button until you're ready to create the star.
