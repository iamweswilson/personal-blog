Today Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were projected to be the next President and Vice-President Elects, respectively. There is LOTS of positivity happening in my Twitter feed, which is not only refreshing but energizing. Hopefully this is the catalyst that can help bring our country, both sides of the isle, together again. That's what I attempted to capture here... all shades of red and blue, coming together again. 

I put together a light version as well.
