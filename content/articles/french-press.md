Hopefully this one is self explanatory... coffee is life. Thank you coffee.

This one challenged me, because it's out of my comfort zone. Feels a bit amatuer, like a poor attempt at a Draplin knock-off. The dark lines in the french press conflict with the flat background, IMO. My thought was that it would help the focal point stand out. And with these flaws, I'm sharing anyway, this is how you get better. :)
