Hopefully this one is self explanatory... coffee is life. Thank you coffee.

This one challenged me, because it's out of my comfort zone. Feels a bit amatuer, but I learned a lot about imitating lighting. The dark lines in the french press conflict with the flat background, IMO. My thought was that it would help the focal point stand out. I picked up a few learnings from the previous [mustard course](/blog/mustard), but the learnings are definitely not complete. And with these flaws, I'm sharing anyway, this is how you get better. :)
