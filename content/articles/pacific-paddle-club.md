Last year my wife and I discovered paddle boarding in the Pacific Northwest and fell in love with it. There are so many bodies of water in Oregon and Washington that the opportunities to get out on the water are almost limitless.

Unfortunately, boards are expensive and getting out there for the first time can be intimidating. My wife and a few of her friends had an idea to help make the sport a little more accessible by organizing beginner rides across the region, eventually providing boards and lessons. Itâ€™s an early idea, but has the potential to be a lot of fun and Iâ€™m excited to see where it goes!

I helped bring a little reality to the idea by creating their logo, doing my best impression of Aaron Draplin with think lines, simple shapes, and bright colors. The style fits outdoors in the PNW so well, itâ€™s hard to not go this direction.

To test that we were using the right balance of sun vs waves, I put together a few variations of each.

I think the end result is balanced, fun and... I might be biased, but Iâ€™d wear this hat, which is the â€˜realâ€™ measure of success ðŸ¤ª
