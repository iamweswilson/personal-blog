12 years ago, I founded a startup. I was a banker with 3 tiny kids and a degree in entrepreneurship. I started a few companies before, all with little to no success. My idea was to have a marketplace where logo designers could sell their unused designs by giving them a fake name and pairing them with a domain name. The concept was good. Getty Images even offered to acquire it early on. 

Fast forward 3 years... I blew through all of the investment received and was selling my company to make right with my users. Too much here to detail, but [TechCrunch does a pretty good job telling the story](https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/20/brandstack-pulled-from-the-deadpool-acquired-by-designcrowd/).

Over the past 9 years, I have mini epiphanies about what I could’ve done differently. So I’m writing them down. 

### Spend more time advancing the design industry instead of trying to  disrupt it. 
Taking a page out of Aaron Draplin’s book, provide a platform for designers to teach each other. 

### Rely on battle tested tools
Spent too much timing building custom tools. 
Because I didn’t rely on battle tested tools, ended up eating thousand of dollars in fraud and needing to reinvent the wheel

### Use those ^ relationships as a way to expand the community 
Had 30k users, most of which were designers. Needed demand to match supply. 

### Bootstrap longer OR spend investment quicker. 
Once I got investment, I was scared to spend it. Needed to level up quicker through hiring and marketing. Was too worried about running out of money, rather than seeing it as a way to accelerate growth.
