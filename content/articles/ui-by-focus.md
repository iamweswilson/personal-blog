I've found the most difficult part of creating marketing pages is gaining and keeping a reader's focus. Focus can be gained through writing, design, and placement. This exercise digs into that challenge a bit, looking at how visual hierarchy, color, spacing, and type can be adjusted based on how much focus you want to bring to that component is to your page.

So here's the exercise... You're creating a marketing page for your product and want to include its features. This features component is going to compete for attention with other items on the page like pricing, user stories, testimonials, customer logos, comparison charts, infographics, etc. (you get the point). You need to decide how much focus "features" should receive. Depending on what you decide, the UI for that component should change. The idea here is that you'd be able to quickly adjust any components to match the level of focus you want it to have on the page.

Give it a shot.

<by-focus></by-focus>

As you can see, the desired focus you set would dictate colors, icons, and text placement. The content is the same across each variant, but the attention brought to the component changes based on how much focus you believe the item should get. It makes sense on a micro level, but in practice, the desired focus would likely also change this component's placement on the page to have a full effect.

Also related, but not shown in this exercise, is that giving more focus to one component would in turn reduce the focus to another component (see list of potential components above), especially if the components are within the same viewport.

Perhaps this is something that can be useful to designers or non-designers at some point in the future. Perhaps it just dies here as a fun exercise in UX using JS and CSS.
