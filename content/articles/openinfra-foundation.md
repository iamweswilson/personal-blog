OpenStack has grown into one of the top 3 most active open source projects in the world, powering some of the world's most critical infrastructure. It's relied upon by massive organizations like Since 2010, the OpenStack Foundation has had the sole purpose of advancing OpenStack the software. Cloud infrastructure has changed since then and so have the needs of those who rely on the cloud. For that reason, the foundation has expanded it's mission to advance open infrastructure beyond OpenStack (which we lovingly refer to as the heart of open infrastructure).

The team designed and developed a fresh, uplifting brand, including the website and additional digital assets, that has revitalized member interest in the organization. The OpenInfra Foundation was launched at the first Virtual Open Infrastructure Summit in 2020.
