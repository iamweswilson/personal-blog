I took a SkillShare course with Aaron Draplin, as a way to see how one of the greats works. He was as energetic as you'd expect and I learned some new tricks. He has an incredible knack for creating interesting design from simple shapes. The concept of designing by subtration blew me away. 

As part of the process, I illustrated this baller mustard bottle. Now it's on my website.
