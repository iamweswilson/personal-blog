I feel like I've been in a creative funk for a while now. Work has been fulfilling, but I've found that I've been missing that rewarding feeling that comes from creating something from nothing. So I decided to set aside a little bit of time for myself to create 'something' every day. The first exercise in creativity was to design a logo for my dog. Louie is a 2-year old frech bulldog with an excellent personality. 

Here he is wearing a tutu, reminding everyone to vote.

So I went through a few iterations as quickly as I could, doing my best impression of Aaron Draplin... build simple shapes, duplicate, and iterate until I came up with something I felt good about. I ended up with a circular logo that feels a lot like a sticker or badge. 

Then in an act of vulnerability, I posted it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamweswilson/status/1319794327699083264) and got a few replies.

I got one funny [reply](https://twitter.com/toddmorey/status/1320121322345762819) and used it as a way to see how the logo would work in another application. I drew every element in these designs from scratch.

I enjoyed creating without the normal requirements and boundaries that clients and/or employers put in place. And I used it as an opportunity to learn a few new illustration techniques in the process. Thikning I'll do a few more fake projects to keep the creative juices flowing.
