For the past several years, my wife and her business partner/friend have been providing consulting services for school districts. The bulk of their work is in helping special education providers better manage their case loads, through the use of complicated spreadsheets and a lot of know how. Over the past year, they have been using those learnings to develop software around the concept. As a good husband with design skills does, I helped them create an identity for the business and new app.
