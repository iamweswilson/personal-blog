An exercise in mascot illustration... sorta. 

When I was a kid, I used to draw this goofy character with big teeth, funny hair and a bulbus nose. I remember sitting in front of the tv trying to replicate Elmer Fudd, hence the bulbus nose and exagerated cheeks. It's the one thing I remember drawing as a kid and it comes back easily, like riding a bike.

Today I took a stab at illustrating him. This is a character that had a life of his own, so I wanted to do it justice. And while it slowly morphed into something a tad different than what I've sketched my whole life, it was a fun learning process.

In the end, it turned into a mascot of a goofball. Since it's been a sketch of mine for as long as I can remember, I've deemed him my inner goofball. It's fitting, because who doesn't have an inner goofball waiting to get out?!
