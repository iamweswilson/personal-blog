    <p>Hi! I am Wes Wilson. I am a designer, marketer and (at times) a front-end developer. Most of my energy goes to being the Director of Marketing for the newly minted <a href="https://openinfra.dev" target="_blank">Open Infrastructure Foundation</a> where we build  communities who write open source software that runs in production.</p>
    <p>Previously, I founded a <a href="https://brandcrowd.com" target="_blank">start-up</a> (sold in 2011), was Director of Product at <a href="https://venturelab.org/" target="_blank">VentureLab</a>, helped build ZippyKid (now <a href="https://pressable.com" target="_blank">Pressable</a>), and spent a few years trying to make a living as a freelance designer.</p>
